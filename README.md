# How to setup SRU18

By: YoPhlox

1. Download files from this repo using
`git clone https://github.com/yophlox/SRU18.git --recursive`

2. Download Unity 2018.2.19f1 if you don't have it (you can still use 2018.2.18f1 since there's no major differences lol)

3. Open the project in Unity

4. Build or Download [Outrun](https://github.com/fluofoxxo/outrun)
    
5. Run outrun

6. Enjoy! (the server is set to localhost by default)

# Note

* This is still a work in progress and this is being done by one person only, so expect development to be slow.
